* There are three plugins that synchronize with each day and decoding.  This plugin is the third of a series developed to expand the use of Natural Time.
* If you like this plugin, you might also like the [__uChing Decoder__](http://wordpress.org/plugins/u-ching-decoder/) and the [__Cosmic History Quotes__](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cosmic-history-quotes/).  Each one synchronizes with the other.
* We're actively seeking translators to work on Russian, Chinese, and all other languages.  Our versions now include: English, Dutch and Spanish.
